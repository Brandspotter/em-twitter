# EM-Twitter

EM-Twitter is a ruby client for the Twitter Streaming API.  It uses EventMachine.

## Usage

## SSL

## Proxy Support

## Error Handling

## Todo

* Gzip encoding support (see [issue #1](https://github.com/spagalloco/em-twitter/issues/1) for more information)

## Inspiration

EM-Twitter is heavily inspired by Vladimir Kolesnikov's [twitter-stream](https://github.com/voloko/twitter-stream).  I learned an incredible amount from studying his code and much of the reconnection handling in EM-Twitter is derived/borrowed from him.

Testing with EM can be a challenge, but was made incredibly easy through the use of Hayes Davis' awesome [mockingbird](https://github.com/hayesdavis/mockingbird) gem.
